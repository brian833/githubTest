# Airbnb Listings Data Analysis

Welcome to my Airbnb Listings Analysis project! As a data analyst, this project aims to explore, clean, visualize, and derive insights from Airbnb data to better understand market trends, pricing strategies, and factors that influence booking rates in different cities.

---

## Project Overview

This project involves an in-depth analysis of Airbnb listings data obtained from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/) or Kaggle. The goal is to:

- Understand how features like location, room type, number of reviews, and availability affect pricing.
- Provide insights for hosts to optimize their listings.
- Explore market saturation and seasonality trends.
- Build a simple machine learning model to predict listing prices.

---

## Dataset

The dataset includes:
- Listing ID, name, host ID
- Neighborhood, location (latitude & longitude)
- Room type, price, minimum nights, availability
- Number of reviews, last review date, review scores

> Note: The dataset used in this project is the [City_Name] Airbnb listing data for [Year], which you can find in the `data/` folder.

## Key Steps

1. Data Cleaning
   - Handling missing values  
   - Removing duplicates  
   - Normalizing and transforming variables  

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
   - Summary statistics  
   - Correlation analysis  
   - Geospatial mapping of listings  

3. Visualizations 
   - Distribution of prices  
   - Reviews vs. price  
   - Availability across neighborhoods  

4. Modeling  
   - Linear regression for price prediction  
   - Feature importance evaluation  

5. Conclusions & Recommendations 
   - Key takeaways for potential hosts  
   - Pricing strategy suggestions
